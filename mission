Well done.  You have decompressed this file and figured out how to open it 
to read its contents.  Now, for your next task...

There are 6 digits left to find.  Once you've found them, combine them and 
visit the resulting URL: 

http://www2.hawaii.edu/~ztomasze/teaching/ics211/2013sp/hw/A10/trophy/######/
  
Good luck...
